# Monty Hall Paradox; Simulation, ML & Demonstration

Dive into the intriguing Monty Hall Paradox: after picking one of three doors, the host reveals a goat behind another, offering a chance to switch. Our goal is to empirically prove the optimal strategy through a 10,000-iteration simulation, demonstrating that changing doors significantly increases winning chances. Additionally, we will train a Machine Learning model to learn and validate this strategy, confirming that the model also favors switching doors for a higher probability of winning the prize.
