# Monty Hall Paradox; Simulation, ML & Demonstration

Dive into the fascinating Monty Hall Paradox: You pick one of three doors, one hiding a prize, two hiding goats. The host, knowing where the car is, opens another door to reveal a goat. You're then offered to switch to the remaining unopened door. The paradox is that switching doors doubles your odds of winning the car.

Our goal is to empirically prove through a 10,000-iteration simulation that changing doors significantly increases winning chances. Additionally, we will train a Machine Learning model to learn and validate this strategy, confirming that the model also favors switching doors for a higher probability of winning the prize.
